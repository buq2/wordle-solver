# Hint file

While playing Wordle/Sanuli, fill in hints file based on the game output.
Hints are formed as follows in the text file:
- One tried word per line.
- Each tried character separated by space.
- Capital letter = this character belongs to this position.
- Lower case letter = this character does not belong here, but is in the word.
- Character prefixed with '!' = character not in the word, or character used too many times and not in this position.

For example
```
!h !e !i !n !Ã¤
!p !u !l !j A
!r !a S !t A
```

# Missing features

- Does not use hints for number of times character appears. For example "E !e" means that letter 'e' only appears ones.
- Does not sort output based on word probability.
